      <p class="bodycopy">SQL Developer 1.5.3 is our first translation release. 
        The translated languages are Japanese, Spanish, Italian, German, French, 
        Brazilian Portuguese, Simplified Chinese and Korean. In addition to the 
        translations, a number of bugs have been fixed for this release. There 
        has been no focus on new functionality. New features are included in SQL 
        Developer 2.0, scheduled for release in 2009. </p>
      <p class="bodycopy">This release does contain support for Kerberos authentication 
        and updates to the LDAP connection support.</p>
      <p class="bodycopy">NOTE: The SQL Worksheet is being rewritten for SQL Developer 
        2.0. As such many existing bugs and requests for the SQL Worksheet have 
        been noted and should be addressed in the next release of SQL Developer, 
        not in SQL Developer 1.5.3.</p>

        <li><span class="bodycopy">Oracle SQL Developer 1.5.3 is available for 
          Windows (XP and Vista (including 64bit)), Linux or the Mac OS X.</span></li>
        <li><strong>Installing or Upgrading:</strong> 
          <ol>
            <li>For SQL Developer releases prior to SQL Developer 1.5, this is 
              a full installation. Download and unzip the file, into an empty 
              folder. Ensure the &quot;Use folder names&quot; checkbox is checked 
              when unzipping the file.</li>
            <li> For SQL Developer 1.5 or SQL Developer 1.5.1, use <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/database/sql_developer/files/check_for_updates.html">Check 
              for Updates</a> to update your existing SQL Developer 1.5.x installation. 
              You should select all the SQL Developer files in the <strong>Check 
              For Updates</strong> dialog. </li>

        </li>
        <li><span class="bodycopy"><strong>Migrating</strong> preferences and 
          connections from previous releases. After you have installed the product 
          you are asked if you want to migrate from a previous release. This migrates 
          previously set preferences and connections created:</span> 
          <ol>
            <li><span class="bodycopy">To migrate your existing Release 1.2.1 
              connections, select <strong>Browse...</strong> on the dialog, navigate 
              to and select the <em>&lt;sqldev 1.2.1 home&gt;\sqldeveloper\sqldeveloper\system</em> 
              folder. In the future these system folder files are stored in the 
              <em>\Documents and Settings\&lt;your_user&gt;\Application Data\SQL 
              Developer</em></span></li>
            <li><span class="bodycopy"> To migrate settings from SQL Developer 
              1.5.x, select <strong>Browse...</strong> on the dialog, navigate 
              to and select the <span class="bodycopy"><em>\Documents and Settings\&lt;your_user&gt;\Application 
              Data\SQL Developer</em> folder. </span></span></li>
            <li>If you are using Oracle SQL Developer 1.1.3 as part of the Oracle 
              Database 11gR1 installation, navigate to [ORACLE_HOME] \product\11.1.0\db_1\sqldeveloper\sqldeveloper\system</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span class="bodycopy">The SQL Developer 1.5.3 release is shipped 
          with JDK1.5.0_06. You can use the embedded JDK or connect to a JDK you 
          have installed. The minimum JDK you should use is 1.5.0_06. If you use 
          JDK1.6 (JDK6.0), the <strong>minimum </strong>you should use is JDK1.6 
          Update 3. SQL Developer does not work with JDK 1.6 Update 1 and 2.</span></li>
        <li>It is recommended that when using SQL Developer on Windows Vista, 
          that you use a minimum of JDK.1.6, as this improves screen repainting 
          issues. </li>
        <li><span class="bodycopy">In Oracle SQL Developer 1.5.3 your user-defined 
          reports, SQL History and user-defined snippets files are located in 
          the <em>\Documents and Settings\&lt;your_user&gt;\Application Data\SQL 
          Developer</em> folder. These are also migrated.</span></li>
        <li><span class="bodycopy"> The JDBC drivers shipped are 11g R1. This 
          means that users will no longer be able to connect to an Oracle 8.1.7 
          database. </span></li>
        <li><span class="bodycopy">This release supports the Sybase 12 and Sybase 
          15 in addition to the current third party databases supported. </span> 
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bodycopy">You will not see any third party tabs in 
              the connections dialog until you have installed the drivers.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bodycopy">You can download and include the third-party 
              database drivers manually. See the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/migration/workbench/files/omwb_getstarted.html">existing 
              documentation</a> for that on OTN. Alternatively y</span>ou can 
              use <strong>Check for Updates</strong> to setup these drivers.</li>
            <li><em>Do not</em> use the latest MySQL driver 5.1. Use the 5.0.x 
              drivers for MySQL.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Before you can use SQL Developer to connect to TimesTen: 
          <ul>
            <li>Install TimesTen 7.0.3 or a later release of the server or client 
              on the same machine as SQL Developer.</li>
            <li> Make sure the CLASSPATH environment variable is pointing to the 
              TimesTen JDBC driver (TimesTen_install_dir/lib/ttjdbc5.jar).</li>
            <li> On Linux systems, execute the shell script TimesTen_install_dir/bin/ttenv.sh 
              or TimesTen_install_dir/bin/ttenv.csh to set up the TimesTen environment 
              before launching SQL Developer.</li>

        <li>Drop view in captured model, click refresh. click edit for that view,

        <li>Deeply nested statements take an exponential amount of time to translate</li>
        <li>Migration generate script sometimes hangs due to migration log thread</li>
        <li>MYSQL&gt; offline datamove - run oracle_ctl got table does not exist 
          error</li>
        <li>Date format masks need to be consistently applied during the migration</li>
        <li>Capture exception cannot sort a row of size 8096</li>
        <li>Max cursors exceeded when migrating more than 1 database</li>
        <li>SQL Server default &quot;for&quot; triggers should be converted to 
          after trigger</li>
        <li>MYSQL quick migration stopped in convert step</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="boldbodycopy">Preferences</p>
      <ul>
        <li>SQL Developer seems to &quot;lose&quot; some key assignments now and 
          then</li>
        <li>NLS preferences override the login trigger and session parameters</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="boldbodycopy">Reports</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Order By date error in &quot;daily ash statistics chart&quot;</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="boldbodycopy">TimesTen</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Commit and rollback behavior for TimesTen DDL and DML operations: 
          Unlike the Oracle database, TimesTen does not implicitly commit DDL 
          transactions. The user must explicitly commit the transactions by clicking 
          the Commit button on the SQL Worksheet.</li>
        <li>Enabling PassThrough can affect the SQL operations in the Connections 
          navigator. Make sure this setting is reset to 0 when switching from 
          PassThrough operations in the SQL Worksheet back to the Connections 
          navigator.</li>
        <li>DDL operations fail with when the Data tab is being viewed. Ensure 
          that the data tab is not viewing the same table that you are performing 
          DDL on. </li>
        <li>You cannot create tables when the SYS.TABLES system table is being 
          viewed in SQL Developer. Viewing the content of SYS.TABLES in the Data 
          tab causes a lock to be placed. All CREATE TABLE statements will be 
          blocked and may eventually time out because of this. The lock is released 
          as soon as the focus of the Data tab is switched to another table. This 
          is fixed in 7.0.5 and later release of the TimesTen In-Memory Database. 
        </li>
        <li>EXPORT DATA &gt; insert generates Oracle-compatible SQL INSERT statements, 
          depending on the underlying data type and the difference in support 
          of literals. These may not be compatible with the TimesTen database. 
        </li>
        <li>EXPORT DATA &gt; ttbulkcp generates an error when the action is performed 
          inside the Data tab. Select this option from the Connections navigator. 
        </li>
        <li>The LIKE filter does not find an exact object match. The workaround 
          is to use = instead of LIKE when defining the filter.</li>
